Utility of the API
==================

AdBlock lists are updated regularly so the blocking of domains or scripts can occur very untimely.

The API gives a possibility to provide you with functioning domains and scripts in real time.
Our system daily verifies the validity of domains and scripts provided by us and in case of blocking
automatically allocates the new ones.

Therefore the implementation of API script has to be done only once and afterwards its functioning is
totally autonomous.
